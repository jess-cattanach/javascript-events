<h1>My Two Menace Cats</h1>

<p class="byline">By: Jessica Cattanach</p>

<p>Since moving into our apartment, my roomates and I decided to get some furry companions. And so we ended up with these two: sisters Cricket and Texas. Cricket has the white socks. Texas is noticeably bigger than her sister (everything's bigger in Texas, hence her name). They are both equally evil in their own way.</p>
